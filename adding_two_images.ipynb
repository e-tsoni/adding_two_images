    "In computer vision, the merging of two images is frequently referred to as image blending or image addition. In a variety of situations, this operation can be helpful in achieving particular goals. These are some actual case studies where the addition of two images is frequently used as a prerequisite to computer vision techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image Fusion:  In applications like remote sensing or surveillance, combining information from different modalities can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the scene.\n",
    "- HDR Imaging (High Dynamic Range): By combining multiple images taken at different exposure levels, HDR imaging aims to represent a broader range of luminance values, enhancing details in both dark and bright areas.\n",
    "- Image Blending for Augmented Reality: When integrating virtual elements into real-world environments, blending the real and virtual images seamlessly is crucial for a realistic augmented reality experience.\n",
    "- Medical Imaging:  Integrating information from MRI and CT scans, for example, to provide a more comprehensive view for diagnosis and treatment planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples show how image addition can be used in a variety of computer vision applications and how it can enhance overall analysis, information representation, and image quality.\n"

    "When we discuss images, we know that they are all based on matrices, which can be binary (0, 1), grayscale (0-255), or RGB (255 255 255).<br>Thus, the image addition correspond to the sum of the two matrices' values.<br>In mathematics, matrices can be added only if they are of the same size, that is, they have the same dimension or order. So, two or more matrices of the same order can be added by adding the corresponding elements of the matrices.<br>\n",

    "In Python, the process of adding two images involves reading the pixel values of corresponding pixels from both images and combining them to create a new image. The OpenCV library is commonly used for image processing tasks.<br>To add two images, you can use the **cv2.add()** function, which adds corresponding pixel values of two images.<br>For instance, if **image1** and **image2** are the two input images, the operation **result = cv2.add(image1, image2)** will add the pixel values of each corresponding pair of pixels from **image1** and **image2**, producing a new image stored in the result variable.<br>Additionally, Python's numpy library is often employed to perform element-wise addition when dealing with image data as NumPy arrays, offering a versatile and efficient approach to image addition in the context of computer vision."
