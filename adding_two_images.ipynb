    "## Image Blending\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer vision, the merging of two images is frequently referred to as image blending or image addition. In a variety of situations, this operation can be helpful in achieving particular goals. These are some actual case studies where the addition of two images is frequently used as a prerequisite to computer vision techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image Fusion:  In applications like remote sensing or surveillance, combining information from different modalities can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the scene.\n",
    "- HDR Imaging (High Dynamic Range): By combining multiple images taken at different exposure levels, HDR imaging aims to represent a broader range of luminance values, enhancing details in both dark and bright areas.\n",
    "- Image Blending for Augmented Reality: When integrating virtual elements into real-world environments, blending the real and virtual images seamlessly is crucial for a realistic augmented reality experience.\n",
    "- Medical Imaging:  Integrating information from MRI and CT scans, for example, to provide a more comprehensive view for diagnosis and treatment planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples show how image addition can be used in a variety of computer vision applications and how it can enhance overall analysis, information representation, and image quality.\n"
